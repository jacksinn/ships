# Instructions

# Todo
Reduce the number of shots on the weapon and don't allow user to attack with it if empty

Build ships based on fundamental characteristics like hull, wings, nose, etc

# Ideas
User can try to avoid getting hit by weapon using their 'evasive maneuvering' based on speed


Have other people repair the ships -- different repairer levels etc
