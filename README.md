# Instructions

# Todo
Reduce the number of shots on the weapon and don't allow user to attack with it if empty

Build ships based on fundamental characteristics like hull, wings, nose, etc

# Ideas
User can try to avoid getting hit by weapon using their 'evasive maneuvering' based on speed
Estimate chance of victory base on ship's stats
Add weapon flavor text (like how it shoots -- pew pew, kaboom)
Have other people repair the ships -- different repairer levels etc
